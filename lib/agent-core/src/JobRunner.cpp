// **Only a login reply answers a login** (task p1.10-47; meshmaster.dk's task p4.32-186 is the
// server's half, which protects an exit node nobody has flashed).
//
// A login reply starts with the **repeater's** clock and carries no tag of ours: `handleLoginReq`
// writes `getCurrentTimeUnique()` into the four bytes `handleRequest` reflects the sender's
// timestamp into (examples/simple_repeater/MyMesh.cpp at 81dbae59, lines 133-135 against 214). So
// a login is awaited with tag 0 - *the next response from this peer* - and until this task
// whatever came next was taken as the login's answer. On a job whose request had just timed out,
// what comes next is that **request's late reply**. meshmaster.dk, 12 November 2026: every one of
// the ten times an active ACL association was parked as *the ACL entry is gone* has this log
// (jobs 24142, 21783, 8293, 19065), and in 24142 the same key had been answered *logged in as
// read-write* three minutes before:
//
//     session reused (acl, read-write, 147 s old);
//     neighbours page at 0 try 1: no reply (direct);
//     no reply on a reused session: logging in again once;
//     login (acl) try 1: refused
//
// So a response that is not a login reply no longer ends the wait: it is dropped, the job's log
// says a reply to something else arrived, and the wait goes on to its end. Then it is *no reply* -
// which is what stock firmware answers a login it will not take anyway - and the second try
// follows as for any silence. Two tests of what a login reply is, and the first is the one a
// parse cannot make:
//
//   - **a tag this job sent** (`Context::sentTag`): a response carrying one is that request's
//     reply, whatever it parses as. A neighbour page of a repeater with no neighbours is
//     `total(i16)` and `returned(i16)`, four zero bytes, zero-padded to the cipher block by
//     `Utils::encrypt` - and `parseLoginReply` reads a first byte of zero as *login ok*, the
//     fourth as the permissions and the ninth as the firmware level, so that page arrives as
//     *logged in as guest, firmware level 0*. A status reply can do the same: its first field is
//     the battery in millivolts, little-endian, so one reading in 256 (4096 mV, 3840 mV) has a
//     low byte of zero, and the two bytes after it are the transmit queue length, whose high
//     byte is the role - guest on any queue below 256;
//   - **bytes that are not a login reply at all**: another kind (a trace, a CLI text) or a
//     response `parseLoginReply` does not know.
//
// Here, in the library, and not only in `AgentMesh`: the Walter has its own `IMesh`, and the rule
// has to hold with one that hands every response through. Nothing is lost by dropping these,
// because **nothing of MeshCore at the pin refuses a login**: `handleLoginReq` answers
// RESP_SERVER_LOGIN_OK or `return 0`, and so do `simple_room_server` and `simple_sensor`. The
// companion's `PUSH_CODE_LOGIN_FAIL` (examples/companion_radio/MyMesh.cpp:716-721) is emitted for
// exactly the response this drops - which is the .NET agent's half of the same bug.
