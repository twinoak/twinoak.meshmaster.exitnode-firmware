// What one answer from meshmaster.dk means for the loop, as a pure function of the status code
// and the Retry-After it carried.
//
// The rules are EXIT-NODES §6 and API §3 as the .NET agent reads them (ServerAnswer in
// Uplink.cs), and tasks/phase-1/02 names three of them outright: a 401 stops everything but the
// console, a 429 honours Retry-After, a 5xx backs off. They live here rather than inside
// src/agent/AgentLoop.cpp so that test/test_server_policy can hold every status code against the
// action it earns without a board.
//
// Task p1.2-10 corrected two of them against the first day on the air. A release of
// meshmaster.dk answers 503 for a minute or two, and five of those cost the board 480 s of
// doubling with the server long since back - the exit node read *quiet* while nothing was wrong
// (bench, 3 October 2026). So: a **5xx that says when to come back is believed**, exactly as the
// 429 is, and the doubling stops at **two minutes once the board's own link is proven**, because
// then the thing that is not answering is the server and a server that comes back deserves a
// call within minutes.
