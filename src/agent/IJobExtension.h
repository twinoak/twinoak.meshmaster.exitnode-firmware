// Job types compiled into the agent beside the thirteen (task p1.5-15): the seam PLUGINS §3 of
// twinoak/meshmaster.dk describes as *handlers compiled into the agent*.
//
// The runner owns everything around a job - the claim, the lease check, the pacing against the
// airtime budget, the result envelope and its log, the post - and the extension owns the job's
// own exchange: it writes the result's `data` object and names the outcome. A claimed job whose
// type is none of the thirteen is offered to the extension (JobRunner::setExtension) before it
// is answered `unsupported`, and the heartbeat advertises the extension's types after the
// thirteen, so the server routes them here at all (routing requires the type advertised). The
// Heltec sets no extension, and its heartbeat is unchanged.
