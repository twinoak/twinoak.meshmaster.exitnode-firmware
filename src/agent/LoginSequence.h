// The two tries of a login, and the blank login between them that tells a wrong password from a
// repeater off the air (EXIT-NODES §7, CONFIGURATION §7 step 4; meshmaster.dk's task p4.7-95,
// whose finding for this repository is task p1.3-13).
//
// `JobRunner::ensureSession` is the .NET agent's `EnsureSessionAsync`: the material of the job's
// class once, and once more when the first try got no reply. Refused is `unauthorized`, silence
// twice is `unreachable` - and on stock firmware a password the repeater does not know is silence
// (`handleLoginReq`, examples/simple_repeater/MyMesh.cpp:89-141 at d9296435, is `return 0` to a
// non-blank password that is neither of its two), so a wrong password and a dead repeater look the
// same from here. That matters in exactly one place: a job handed the **new** candidate of an
// `unverified` credential rotation, where the server's fallback to the old candidate is keyed to
// a refusal and a silence would leave the row unverified for ever.
//
// The .NET agent's answer (task p4.7-95) is a **blank** login between the two tries: this exit
// node's own key and no password, the `acl` login every status read makes. `handleLoginReq`'s
// first statement answers it at the ACL entry's level for any key the ACL holds, and its second
// answers *guest* (and writes a guest entry) on a repeater with no guest password set. Answered at
// any level - a refusal is an answer too - the repeater is on the air, and a second silence to
// the candidate right after it is the password's silence: `unauthorized`, with `LoginSilentResult`
// as the data so the server can tell it from a refusal the repeater spoke and from a silence that
// taught nothing. Silent too, nothing is known: `unreachable`, as before. The **second** try is
// the one judged, not the first - a reply the mesh ate is how the row became unverified in the
// first place, and a second try the repeater answers is a plain login that settles the row.
//
// One transaction more, on that path only. The probe stores no session: the next job is a
// candidate job and logs in afresh anyway.
//
// The policy is here, on a host, so that every path can be walked against a scripted exchange
// (test/test_rotation_probe); the board supplies the logins (JobRunner.cpp's LoginOnTheAir),
// the way ConfigApply.h's engine and ApplyOnTheAir divide an apply.
