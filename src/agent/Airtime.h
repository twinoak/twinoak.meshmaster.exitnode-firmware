// The airtime budget at the point of transmission (EXIT-NODES §5, §8).
//
// One transaction at a time, ever; at least `minGapSeconds` between the starts of two; at most
// `maxTransactionsPerMinute` started in any sixty seconds. A burst of claimed jobs is executed at
// this pace and never refused - a read that would exceed the budget waits. The budget is the
// server's, heard on every heartbeat, and may be tightened here and never loosened.
//
// The arithmetic is the .NET agent's `Throttle` (src/MeshMaster.Agent/Budget.cs): an exact
// sliding window of the last starts, and the longer of "the gap since the last start" and "until
// the oldest start in the window is a minute old". `transactionsFor()` beside it is
// `TransactionCosts.For` (src/MeshMaster.Core/Transport/PlannedLoad.cs), which is the table of
// EXIT-NODES §7 as code and what the server's planned load prices a schedule with - so what this
// board spends and what the page promised are the same number.
//
// Host-portable: millisecond counts in, nothing else.
