// The server as the agent loop and the job runner see it (task p1.5-15): the calls of API §3,
// each answering a `Call` record that ServerPolicy.h reads, and the state of the link they go
// over.
//
// `AgentClient` (AgentClient.h) is the WiFi implementation - HTTPS with the chain verified, the
// token read from NVS for the call and wiped after - and stays board-side; the Walter of the
// repeater-v2 design speaks the same seven calls through its modem. `TlsRoots.h` and the rail
// "verified, never bypassed" apply to both.
//
// Two of the seven the reference agent never makes but the protocol has (API §3):
// `POST /agent/v1/jobs/{id}/extend` and `POST /agent/v1/jobs/{id}/progress`, for a job that runs
// past its lease and wants to say so. Nothing on the Heltec calls them yet.
