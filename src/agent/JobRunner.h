// One job at a time: claim, run, report (EXIT-NODES §5, §6, §7).
//
// The .NET agent's JobRunner has a companion on a cable and a handler per type; here the board
// **is** the companion, so each handler is a direct call into the mesh - the same primitives the
// companion firmware runs when a phone asks, behind IMesh (IMesh.h) since task p1.5-15 - and the
// reply arrives in the callbacks src/mesh/AgentMesh.h has. Simpler on the wire, and the same
// result shapes on the server: what is posted is held to the .NET agent's bytes by
// test/test_job_results and test/test_config_read.
//
// Thirteen types. Four of them log in as this board and nothing else (task 03):
//
//   status      REQ_TYPE_GET_STATUS, and at class `acl` the owner-info request too, for the
//               firmware version the association's verify step records
//   telemetry   REQ_TYPE_GET_TELEMETRY_DATA, Cayenne LPP decoded with the channel-0 rule
//   neighbours  REQ_TYPE_GET_NEIGHBOURS, nine a page, eight-byte prefixes, paged to the count
//   trace       a trace packet along the round trip; `unsupported` at no transaction when the
//               path is built of three-byte hashes, which a trace packet cannot express
//
// and three carry the repeater's admin password for the length of the job (task 04; where it
// lives and what may see it is agent/Credentials.h):
//
//   discover    an admin login - direct along a known path, which verifies it; flooded when
//               none is known, and the path its reply came back along - and the path-discovery
//               request last, only when neither login was answered (tasks p3.5-39, 40, 41)
//   acl.set     `setperm <key> <level>` on the admin session, the reply captured; on our own
//               key the command is the session's level and the cache follows it (task p4.1-60)
//   config.read the `get` list in order, `region` and `region default`, `ver` and `board`, and
//               the access-list request last (admin only, 23 entries at most, its silence after
//               keys were read tolerated: tasks p3.5-43, p4-49, p4-57)
//
// and six change a repeater (task 05; tasks p4-53, 54, 55, 57), every one of them one send per
// command - a `set` sent twice is a change made twice - on an admin session, with the sender
// timestamps strictly increasing (the RTC's unique second, which every tag and every CLI line of
// this board come from):
//
//   config.apply  the plan's commands in order, each exactly once, every reply kept, stopped at
//                 the first reply that is not what the line expects and at the first silence
//                 (`not-sent` for the rest); a regions entry as its lines, the ones that expect
//                 no reply sent without waiting and the terminator sent even when the sequence
//                 dies; then the re-read of every touched key and `ver`. The policy is
//                 agent/ConfigApply.h, which runs on a host; this file puts its lines on the air
//   cli           one line as the server handed it, one reply, both recorded; the blocked list
//                 is the server's, and this firmware refuses nothing but a malformed line
//   advert.request  `advert` (the flood) or `advert.zerohop`, answered `OK - Advert sent`
//   clock.sync    `time <unix>` from this board's clock, the reply recorded, a refusal
//                 (`(ERR: clock cannot go backwards)`) recorded as the refusal it is
//   password.set  `password <new>` or `set guest.password <new>` with the value the claim
//                 carried, once; the admin echo compared with what was sent and recorded as
//                 `<set>`, never the value; the restore **after** the password line, and the
//                 session dropped whatever came back
//   reboot        `reboot`, which the firmware never answers: `ok` as sent on silence, no
//                 restore (there is no session after it, and before it a restore would make the
//                 command unanswerable), the session dropped
//
// A fourteenth and after: a type that is none of the thirteen is offered to the extension the
// board set, if any (IJobExtension.h), before it is answered `unsupported`. The runner still owns
// the pacing, the lease, the envelope and the log; the extension writes the data and the outcome.
//
// **Every admin session on a repeater where this exit node holds a grant ends with the restore**
// (task p4.1-60): `setperm <own key> <granted level>` as the session's last command, because on
// stock firmware the login table *is* the ACL and the admin login has just rewritten our entry
// to admin. The level travels in the claim's `acl`; after the command the cache holds the
// session at class `acl`, reusable by the next acl-class job and invisible to an admin-class
// one. A blank login the repeater answered *above* the grant restores the same way, at once. An
// `acl.set` on our own key sends no second `setperm`: the command is the level. Two types cannot
// end that way (task 60 as built): `password.set` restores after its password line and only then
// drops the session, and `reboot` restores not at all.
//
// The pacing is the budget the heartbeat last carried (agent/Airtime.h): one transaction at a
// time, the gap between two, the ceiling in a minute. A board has one thread, so a job's waiting
// is the loop's waiting - `pump` is what keeps the console and the OLED alive through it.
//
// Host-portable since task p1.5-15: the mesh, the server and the platform are the three seams
// (IMesh.h, IUplink.h, IPlatform.h), and the scratch every job shares is this object's own
// (Scratch, below) rather than a translation unit's statics.
