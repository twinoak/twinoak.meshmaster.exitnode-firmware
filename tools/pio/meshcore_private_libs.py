# MeshCore's private libraries, for a consumer of the package.
#
# MeshCore keeps its ed25519 implementation in its own lib/ed25519 - a PlatformIO *private*
# library of its project, which is exactly what a project that depends on MeshCore as a package
# does NOT get: lib_extra_dirs pointed at it does not reach the dependency's own sources either,
# because a library with a manifest resolves its dependencies from that manifest and ed25519 is
# not in it. So the sources are added to the build here, from the pinned checkout and never
# copied into this repository, and the include path is in platformio.ini beside the variant's.
#
# A pin bump that moves or renames lib/ed25519 fails here, loudly, which is the
# point - docs/upstream.md lists this file among the places a bump re-reads.
